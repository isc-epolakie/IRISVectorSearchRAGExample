The remaining settings are common to all business operations. For information, see Settings for All Business Operations.

Charset
Specifies the desired character set for the output file. InterSystems IRIS® automatically translates the characters to this character encoding. See Charset in Settings for the File Inbound Adapter.

File Path
Full pathname of the directory into which to write output files. This directory must exist, and it must be accessible through the file system on the local InterSystems IRIS Interoperability machine.

Open Timeout
Amount of time for the adapter to wait on each attempt to open the output file for writing.

The default is 5 seconds.

Overwrite
If a file of the same name exists in the FilePath directory, the Overwrite setting controls what happens. If True, overwrite the file. If False, append the new output to the existing file.
